# Multiple vehicle routing for waste collection

This project was developed as my end of degree thesis. The full thesis document, containing a guide of usage as an annex can be found [here.](https://github.com/LovetheFrogs/TFG-Gestion-de-residuos-urbanos/blob/main/Docs/Thesis_use_guide.pdf) Note that due to my college being in Spain, the thesis and the guide are written in spanish.
